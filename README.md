### PURPOSE.

Having taken a csv file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks), I have proceeded with data cleaning that allows me validate my hypothesis. The results from mentioned validation has been showed visually on charts.

### PROCEDURE.

More generally, the procedure used would be as follows. 

1- Understanding data from dataset and make a first cleaning.

2- I have prepared four hypothesis that, in my case, would be the following:
- USA is country that have the most quantity of accidents caused by shark attack.
- The major part of the accidents are non provoked.
- Fishing and Surfing are the major causes of accidents.
- More men die due to this cause of accident than women.

3- Cleaning and validation.

4- Showing data on charts.
